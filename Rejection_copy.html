    1. Denial: When you are unable to accept the situation <br>
    2. Anger: Once realization dawns upon you, it can feel frustrating knowing you were rejected <br>
    3. Bargaining: This is when you try to rationalize with the situation and attempt to change it for your own benefit <br>
    4. Depression: Once you realize nothing can be done, you enter a deep state of sadness. <br>
    4. Acceptance: After all these emotions flood through you will you finally come to terms with the rejection and feel ready to move on. <br> <br>
    However, many people fly through these stages for different lengths of time and feels these emotions differently. <br> 
    What's important is to take a step back from the situation and try not to let your emotions get the best of you.
